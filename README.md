# Diabete_classification

## Description
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on certain health-related features using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**. We apply various **machine learning classification models** including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**

We also explore different methods for handling missing values and evaluate model performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 768 entries with 8 features and a binary outcome indicating whether or not a patient has diabetes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
